TODO:

GENERAL FRONTEND:
	[x] Fetch new token when current one expires
	[ ] Reconnect on server disconnect (setTimeout)

SERVERS:
	[x] Fetch user servers
	[x] Render user servers
	[x] Make user servers clickable
	[x] Create server
	[x] Join server
	[x] Leave server

CHAT:
	[x] Connecting to the websocket server
	[x] Send packets from user to server
	[x] Send packets from server to user
	[x] Render new messages
	[ ] Get previous messages (build this html on server)
	[ ] Route messages to correct servers
	[ ] FIX global chat


USERS:
	[ ] Get server users
	[ ] Get current active users in server
	[ ] Sign out button functional


NOTES:
	· User can send messages to any chat. I don't validate user validity.

THINGS THAT COULD BE BETTER:
	· Instead of looping every ws. I should have a dictionary with keys being the servers and values being array of websockets connected to them.

message = {
	user,
	message,
	server it was sent in,
	timestamp
}

global_msg => global guid
local_msg => local guid
