TODO:

USERS:

NOTES:
	· User can send messages to any chat. I don't validate user validity.

THINGS THAT COULD BE BETTER:
	· Instead of looping every ws. I should have a dictionary with keys being the servers and values being array of websockets connected to them.

message = {
	user,
	message,
	server it was sent in,
	timestamp
}

global_msg => global guid
local_msg => local guid
